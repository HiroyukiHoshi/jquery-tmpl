## This repository is no longer the home of the official jQuery Templates plugin, which is now at [http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl](http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl).

The code source has been removed in the latest commit, to prevent confusion, leaving just this readme. 

### History of this repository
This repository was originally forked from John Resig's <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery/jquery-tmpl</a> 'micro-templating' prototype. Extensive changes and additions were made, and the resulting plugin has now been adopted by jQuery as an _Official jQuery Plugin_. 

See <a href="http://www.borismoore.com/2010/10/jquery-templates-is-now-official-jquery.html">http://www.borismoore.com/2010/10/jquery-templates-is-now-official-jquery.html</a> for more background. 

The code that was in this repository was therefore pulled into the main <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery/jquery-tmpl</a> repository, which is now the <strong>official _JQuery Templates_ plugin repository</strong>. (The pulled code is the Beta1 release of the official plugin).
