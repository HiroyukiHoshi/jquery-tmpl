# jQuery Templates plugin - experimental version

If you are looking for the official _jQuery Templates_ plugin, you can find it here:
<a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery/jquery-tmpl</a>.

### History of this repository
This repository was originally forked from John Resig's <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery/jquery-tmpl</a> 'micro-templating' prototype. Extensive changes and additions were made, and the resulting plugin has now been adopted by jQuery as an _Official jQuery Plugin_. 

See <a href="http://www.borismoore.com/2010/10/jquery-templates-is-now-official-jquery.html">http://www.borismoore.com/2010/10/jquery-templates-is-now-official-jquery.html</a> for more background. 

The code that was in this repository has therefore been pulled back into the main <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery/jquery-tmpl</a> repository, which is now the <strong>official _JQuery Templates_ plugin repository</strong>. 

### Relationship between this fork and the official _jQuery Templates_ plugin.
This fork will now be maintained for ongoing work on new features or fixes that could later become part of the official jQuery Templates plugin. Of course there is no guarantee that any specific additional feature in this fork will be included in a later version of <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery/jquery-tmpl</a>.
