# jQuery Templates plugin

_Note: this plugin requires jquery version 1.4.2._
 
jQuery templates contain markup with binding expressions. Templates are applied to data objects or arrays, and rendered into the HTML DOM.

### jQuery Templates is now an _Official jQuery Plugin_.

This repository was originally forked from John Resig's <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery/jquery-tmpl</a> 'micro-templating' prototype. Extensive changes and additions were made, and the resulting plugin has now been adopted by jQuery as an _Official jQuery Plugin_. See <a href="http://www.borismoore.com/2010/10/jquery-templates-is-now-official-jquery.html">http://www.borismoore.com/2010/10/jquery-templates-is-now-official-jquery.html</a> for more background. 

As a result, the code in this repository has been pulled back into the main <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery/jquery-tmpl</a> repository. 

A full set of documentation for the official version of this plugin is now available on the jQuery documentation site:
<a href="http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates">http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/</a>.

### Relationship between this fork and the official _jQuery Templates_ plugin.

This fork will now be maintained for ongoing work on new features or fixes that could later become part of the official jQuery Templates plugin. Of course there is no guarantee that any specific additional feature in this fork will be included in a later version of <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl">jquery/jquery-tmpl</a>.
